# Game Coach App

In this project I moved away from tutorials and did everything on my own, struggled hard in some parts, but turned out fine.
Started as a small application to register and receive requests to test my skills.
But branched out to communicate with other API(supaDB) and using a database(firebase);
Kinda happy with the results, I think there's more to add and improve, but need to stop since I don't see much use in this application.
